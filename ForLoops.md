# C# Exercise: Print Numbers with a For Loop

In this exercise, you will learn how to use a `for` loop in C# to print numbers from 10 up to 100, increasing by a value of 10 each time.

## Steps:

1. Open your Visual Studio Code editor.

2. Create a new C# file and name it `PrintNumbers.cs`.

3. In the `PrintNumbers.cs` file, write a code that prints numbers from 10 up to 100 with increasing value of 10.

4. Save the file.

5. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code by clicking on `View -> Terminal`.

6. Compile and run the C# program by typing `csc PrintNumbers.cs` and then `PrintNumbers.exe` in the terminal.

You should see the numbers 10, 20, 30, ..., 100 printed in the terminal.

## HINT:

In the code above, we use a `for` loop to iterate over a range of numbers. The loop starts at 10 (`int i = 10`), ends at 100 (`i <= 100`), and increments by 10 each time (`i += 10`). Inside the loop, we use the `Console.WriteLine()` method to print the current value of `i` to the console.
