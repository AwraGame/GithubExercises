# C# Exercise: Print a String

In this exercise, you will learn how to print a string in C#. The goal is to print the string "This is a game project".

## Steps:

1. Open your Visual Studio Code editor.

2. Create a new C# file and name it `PrintString.cs`.
   
3. Write a C# code that prints the string "This is a game project".
   
4. Save the file.

5. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code by clicking on `View -> Terminal`.

6. Compile and run the C# program by typing `csc PrintString.cs` and then `PrintString.exe` in the terminal.

You should see the output "This is a game project" in the terminal.

## HINTS:

You start by declaring a string variable `gameProject` and assign it the value "This is a game project". We then use the `Console.WriteLine()` method to print the value of `gameProject` to the console.

## Note:

Make sure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine to compile and run C# programs. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the [official .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
